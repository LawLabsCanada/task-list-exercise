# Task List Exercise

## Overview

The goal is to create a simple task list application using Angular, NGXS for state management, and TailwindCSS for styling.
This exercise is designed to understand a candidate's thought process, problem-solving approach, and programming style.
Candidates have the freedom to implement features and structure the application as they see fit, allowing for creative solutions and personal coding style.

## Tech Stack

- Angular
- NGXS for state management
- TailwindCSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- No backend required - all state managed in memory

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Display tasks in a list format
- Show task creation date
- Form validation

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies
3. Run `yarn start` to start the development server
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the application

## Development Notes

- All styling is done using TailwindCSS utility classes
- No SCSS files are used in this project
- State management is handled through NGXS

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code organization and structure
- Component design and reusability
- State management implementation with NGXS
- UI/UX implementation with TailwindCSS
- Code cleanliness and best practices

## Bonus Points

- Implement task filtering
- Add animations for task completion/deletion
- Implement task editing
